# Plant pheotyping using computer vision
Please use, cite, and contribute to Plant growth tracker (PGT)! If you have questions, please submit them via the [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/jiayinghsu/plant_growth_tracker/issues).

## Introduction 
PGT is an open-source pipeline for tracking plant's growth. PGT handles the problems of inconsistent coordinates, angles, lighting and distances during the initial phase of data collection. PGT allows more reliable comparison among different experimental conditions by minimizing these technical caveats.
